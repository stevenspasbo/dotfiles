# dotfiles

## Repo of all my dotfiles

Fork my dots!

Currently a work in progress. I'm working on the Rakefile to ease the backup of old dotfiles and installation of new ones.

Installation is pretty simple as long as you have rake.

1) `git clone --recursive https://github.com/stevenspasbo/dotfiles.git`

2) Run 'rake install_everything'

Note: When cloning, include --repository flag to also clone submodules, otherwise you'll need to run 'git submodule update --init'
