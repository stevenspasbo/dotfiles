* My dotfiles

Installation is pretty straight forward.

** Make sure required packages are installed
Don't run this unless you trust me.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevenspasbo/dotfiles/master/install.sh)
#+END_SRC

** Check out the repository
#+begin_src sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/stevenspasbo/dotfiles.git
#+end_src
Note: When cloning, include --repository flag to also clone submodules, otherwise you'll need to run
#+begin_src sh
git submodule update --init
#+end_src

** Create symlinks for all dotfiles
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rake install_dotfiles
#+END_SRC
